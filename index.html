                      <p>
                        The Lake District is by far the UK's most popular national park.
                        Ever since the Romantic poets arrived in the 19th century, its
                        postcard panorama of craggy hilltops, mountain tarns and glittering
                        lakes has been stirring the imaginations of visitors.

                          this part of Wales offers rich opportunity for various water sports, walking and birdwatching.

                          This scattered archipelago of 70 islands has a time-worn, slightly
                          mystical charm of its own.On the Orkney Islands, travelers will
                          be rewarded with storm-battered cliffs, ancient stone circles,
                          and ominous-looking “sea stacks,” which rise from the churning blue
                          water like swords.

                      You can't get further west in England than the ancient Celtic kingdom
                      of Cornwall. Blessed with
                      the southwest's wildest coastline and most breathtakingly beautiful
                      beaches, this proudly independent peninsula has always marched to its own tune.

                  <p>
                    Rolling across the Pennines' southernmost hills is the glorious
                    Peak District National Park. Ancient stone villages are folded
                    into creases in the landscape, and the hillsides are littered
                    with stately homes and rocky outcrops.
